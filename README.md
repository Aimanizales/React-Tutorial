## What is react?
It's a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces

## Q&A To Do:
1. Why is mandatory `super(props)` needed in constructor function?
2. Why using `slice()`?... Not clear
3. WTF is Immutability and why is important?
4. Why `props` doesn't use `this` (like `this.props`) in funcional components?
